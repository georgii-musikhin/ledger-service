# Toy ledger

## Definitions

**Ledger** is a program which logs transactions and applies them to accounts.

**Account** is a record in a database which aggregates transactions applied to it.

**Transaction** is a movement of money.

**Balance of an account** is the sum of all transaction amounts applied to it.

**Value date** is the date when a transaction becomes effective, so its amount is applied.

## Modus operandi

In initial state of this project, it has a couple of features:

* create an account;
* create and apply a transaction to some account;
* check account balance.

## Livecoding

During the live coding session, we will ask you to add features or fix bugs in this program. To
better perform the task, please create a project in your favorite IDE or editor and reach a point
where you can easily compile it and run tests. Docker isn't currently required for the project to
run, but it may be helpful during the session. It's also useful to take a quick look at how the code
is structured and how it works.
